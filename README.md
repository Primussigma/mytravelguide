# MyTravelGuide Mobile Application

###### We are JCS Software Solutions and this is our INFO 3604 Final Project.

## Project Title
###### MyTravelGuide is an Android flutter application to track boat current location, estimate arrival time and display boat schedule.

## Project Description
###### MyTravelGuide is an Android application that allows users to view expected arrival times, boat schedules, and current positions of boats tracked by the system in an easy-to-understand tabular format as well as on a virtual map. It would allow users to add tickets to their cart, which would subsequently display the ticket's total and current date for ticket purchase. Users can also use the app to send emails to the MyTravelGuide support email address. A user is able to receive push notifications in the background from MyTravelGuide about cancellation and rescheduling of a boat.


## How To Install and Run Project as a Debug Build
###### Step 1. Ensure that VS Code is installed by following the instructions given in this link  https://code.visualstudio.com/download
######      or 
###### Android Studio is installed by following the instructions given in this link  https://developer.android.com/studio

###### Note: We suggest utilizing VS Code as your developmental and test environment  and searching for and enabling flutter and dart extensions. It is expected that you would be able to run the code out of all the environments listed  in the Flutter docs as having official support, but we chose VS Code due to personal preference and prior experience. The following assumes you are using VS Code

###### Step 2. Download and configure Flutter for your environment  following the instructions in this link https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install 

###### Step 3: Clone this repository to your local directory of choice.

###### Step 4: Navigate to mytravelguide/mtg_client and open the my_app directory in VS Code.

###### Step 5: Select the device you wish to deploy the application to in the status bar. This would allow you to start the emulated Android Device you created previously in Step 2 . VS Code should automatically detect the open emulator.

###### Step 6: Open a terminal instance in VS Code if one is not already open, and run “flutter clean” then run “flutter pub get”

###### Step 7: Enter ‘flutter run’ into the terminal to create a debug build of the app and automatically deploy that debug APK to the connected emulated Android device.

## Demo a Release Build
###### You can install the app via the Google Play Store:
###### https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.project.mytravelguide
