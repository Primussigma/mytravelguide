# MyTravelGuide Mobile Application

###### We are JCS Software Solutions and this is our INFO 3604 Final Project.

## Project Title
###### MyTravelGuide is an Android flutter application to track boat current location, estimate arrival time and display boat schedule.

## Project Description
###### MyTravelGuide is an Android application that allows users to view expected arrival times, boat schedules, and current positions of boats tracked by the system in an easy-to-understand tabular format as well as on a virtual map. It would allow users to add tickets to their cart, which would subsequently display the ticket's total and current date for ticket purchase. Users can also use the app to send emails to the MyTravelGuide support email address. A user is able to receive push notifications in the background from MyTravelGuide about cancellation and rescheduling of a boat.
